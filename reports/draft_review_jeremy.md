# Jeremy Ryan report review
I'm reviewing [*Epidemic Simulation Using Real-World Graph Shape*](https://github.com/eriakul/Complexity_Science_Project_1/blob/master/reports/draft_report.md) by Erika Lu and Adam Selker.

## Abstract, Purpose, Prior Work
- Effectively introduced topic and explain importance in real world.
- Lots of blanks at the moment, but that's fine at this point in the project.
- Clear and concise explanation of SEIR model.

## Procedure, Results, and Interpretation
- How are the results of your model being validated against real behavior? The report draft just states that it "rises and falls in a manner which is consistent with real infection."
- How are vaccinations being modeled? Simply as some percentage of individuals starting in the 'recovered' state?
- Hard to evaluate appropriateness of limitations and whatnot without more details on the experiment and validation.

## Overall
Report is very professional, well-worded, and informative. The basic pieces of the model are explained clearly, and although there are holes in the report that still need to be filled in, it seems cohesive and well thought-out. I look forward to seeing your completed project.
