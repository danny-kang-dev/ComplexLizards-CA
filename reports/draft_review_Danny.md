# Draft Review
By Danny Kang

## **Question**
This report considers food web with emphasis on effect of removing functional connections. My understanding of this report is that it compares actual food web model and their own model purely based off of degree centrality. I hope there are more explanations about what functional connections means and what degree centrality means.(does it simply mean high degree?)

---
## **Methodology**
According to the methodology section, they experiment with effect of removing nodes with high degrees of centrality and removing functional nodes. I am curious how the graph is constructed, although it seems plausible that it is a graph with nodes as species and edge between them if species are in predator prey relationship. (Is it directed graph?) Also, more explanation about terms such as functional nodes and degrees of centrality would be good in my opinion. 

---
## **Results**
I understand that the graph displays the relationship between extinction percentage and removal of nodes. Also, all the axes are labeled. 

---
## **Interpretation**
I believe that explaining quantitatively about increase in extinction percentage would be helpful.(What does 1percent increase in extinction after removing 25 nodes imply?)

---
## **Replication**
The result is consistent with the result from the original paper about relationship between removal functional nodes and extinction. 

---
## **Extension**
Extension of this report is comparing effects of removing central nodes and functional nodes on extinction. This could answer the question of which node with which properties have greater effect on the food web, which is not explicitly addressed by the original paper. 

---
## **Progress**
Explaining explicitly about how food web was transformed to graph would be extremely helpful.( e.g. how the number of nodes/species is determined) Also, phrasing the paper like 'We would like to go beyond the original paper by experimenting with [extensions]' would make it more obvious that the report has some stretch goals, in my opinion. Otherwise, there is a reasonable progress in terms of replication, experiment, and result. 

---
## **Presentation**
It is presented in concise, clear and correct language. The goal of the paper is also clearly addressed, which is comparing effects of functional nodes and nodes with high degree of centrality. 

---
## **Mechanics**
The report is in correct markdown format. Also, it is located in right directory under reports.
