# A Review of Investigating Methodologies for Increasing the Effectiveness of Transportation Networks
By, Nick Sherman


## Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

Overall, you're trying to test to see how you can increase the effectiveness of bicycle paths. I definitely understand this, and it answers the question of what paths the city should add to most increase the bikability of the city. The team's explanation is fairly clear, as I can definitely grasp what they are trying to do.

## Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

What transportation network systems did you actually load into your system?

Reasonable methodology that leads to why you selected just the bike layer of transportation.

Did you consider average time it takes to traverse a given edge, or just the distance of edges?

It's kinda hard to see the difference in the Amsterdam example you showed. I only see a single line difference?

The methodology overall seems to make sense with the question.

The biggest limitation (as I mentioned above) is that I don't think I could replicate this due to a lack of data that you're instantiating the graph with...

## Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I understand what you're saying for the results section, but you should look into some of the things you mentioned (like average path length, connectedness, and average commute time of the graphs).

Overall, your results visually show that you should look into L2C more, but some more numbers/graphs showing different node networks and how the numbers change would be a lot more convincing.

The visualizations you have are effective (comparing Detroit's improved connectivity), but you need to convince me more with more images showing this and (hopefully) more comparisons of current connectedness/directedness to new connectivity/directedness.

All figures have titles that seem fairly reasonable.

## Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

You recognize that you need to look at directedness and connectedness, which are both good metrics you should look at. However, you should discuss more as to which one you value more and how much you care about both in order to get a better approximate for what paths mathematically are the best to add.

Although acknowledging factors such as geographic layout and population habits is good, you should try to make a stronger rationale for cities to "consider this model" for some reason.

Overall, your argument isn't strong enough without the mathematical/numerical backing you'll get from doing a deeper analysis of the graphs. Also, try to stand firmly that "cities should consider this" but acknowledge they shouldn't use this alone.

## Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency.  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

Note: I didn't actually see the original paper in the draft and therefore went to the project proposal to view it.

The preliminary results seem to correlate what the original paper said, but they never explicitly said this. The correlations are just qualitative as of now.

## Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I don't see an extension here? It looks like they just used the same algorithms that the original paper did? Although there was a heft amount of work that went into this, so just replicating it would be a lot of work. Extension may be the cities you applied it to (I don't know all cities you applied the algorithms to).

## Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

The team is getting there with replication but need to do a little bit of math behind it (it isn't that much work compared to the replication part). The only reason I would be a little worried is the amount of work you would want to do on an extension.

## Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

The report is written clearly and concisely.

The report is consistent with the audience of goals of the report.

With regards to the class's recommendations: You need to add more detail to methodology and do a little more mathematical analysis for the results. You also need a bibliography, and to present your sub-experiments a little more clearly as the way it's phrased right now you have one big experiment but I suspect you have a few (around connectivity, directedness, and length of edges added).

##Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?

The report is in the right directory with the right name. The formatting also seems pretty professional. I see a reasonable title and the full names of the authors. **I DID NOT SEE A BIBLIOGRAPHY!**
